                        sick, feel comfortable (including psychologically) and <br> well. We are supported by 87
                        volunteers
                        and 28 employees of <br> various skill levels. About 12% of the animals are taken by the <br>
                        shelter
                        staff. Taking care of the animals, they become attached <br> to the pets and would hardly ever
